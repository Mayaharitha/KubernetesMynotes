Using Kubernetes Services with DNS
-----------------------------------
Introduction
Kubernetes Services can be located with the Kubernetes DNS just like Pods can. In this lab, you will work with the Kubernetes DNS to discover Services from within a Pod. This will test your knowledge of how to interact with Services using DNS.

Solution
Log in to the control plane server using the credentials provided:

ssh cloud_user@<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>
Perform an Nslookup for a Service in the Same Namespace
Start using the busybox Pod in the web namespace to perform an nslookup on the web-frontend Service by entering:

kubectl exec -n web busybox -- nslookup web-frontend
Redirect the output to save the results in a text file by using:

kubectl exec -n web busybox -- nslookup web-frontend >> ~/dns_same_namespace_results.txt
Look up the same Service using the fully qualified domain name by entering:

kubectl exec -n web busybox -- nslookup web-frontend.web.svc.cluster.local
Redirect the output to save the results of the second nslookup in a text file by using:

kubectl exec -n web busybox -- nslookup web-frontend.web.svc.cluster.local >> ~/dns_same_namespace_results.txt
Check that everything looks okay in the text file by using:

cat ~/dns_same_namespace_results.txt
Use clear to clear the text file output.

Perform an Nslookup For a Service in a Different Namespace
Use the busybox Pod in the web namespace to perform an nslookup on the user-db Service in the data namespace, while only utilizing the short Service name, by entering:

kubectl exec -n web busybox -- nslookup user-db
This first request is supposed to result in an error message, so don't be alarmed if you see that we can't resolve user-db.

Save the results of this nslookup in a text file by using:

kubectl exec -n web busybox -- nslookup user-db >> ~/dns_different_namespace_results.txt
Perform the same lookup using the fully qualified domain name by entering:

kubectl exec -n web busybox -- nslookup user-db.data.svc.cluster.local
Save the results in a text file by using:

kubectl exec -n web busybox -- nslookup user-db.data.svc.cluster.local >> ~/dns_different_namespace_results.txt
Check the output in the text file by using:

cat ~/dns_different_namespace_results.txt
Conclusion
Congratulations — you've completed this hands-on lab!
