Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA): Practice Exam: Part 6
----------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction
This lab provides practice scenarios to help prepare you for the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) Exam. You will be presented with tasks to complete, as well as server(s) and/or an existing Kubernetes cluster to complete them in. You will need to use your knowledge of Kubernetes to successfully complete the provided tasks, much like you would on the real CKA exam. Good luck!

Solution
Log in to the server using the credentials provided:

ssh cloud_user@<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>
Drain the Worker1 Node
Switch to the acgk8s context:
kubectl config use-context acgk8s
Attempt to drain the worker1 node:
kubectl drain acgk8s-worker1
Does the node drain successfully?
Override the errors and drain the node:
kubectl drain acgk8s-worker1 --delete-local-data --ignore-daemonsets --force
Check the status of the exam objectives:
./verify.sh
Create a Pod That Will Only Be Scheduled on Nodes with a Specific Label
Add the disk=fast label to the worker2 node:
kubectl label nodes acgk8s-worker2 disk=fast
Create a YAML file named fast-nginx.yml:
vim fast-nginx.yml
In the file, paste the following:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: fast-nginx
  namespace: dev
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    disk: fast
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
Save the file:
ESC
:wq
Create the fast-nginx pod:
kubectl create -f fast-nginx.yml
Check the status of the pod:
kubectl get pod fast-nginx -n dev -o wide
Check the status of the exam objectives:
./verify.sh
Conclusion
Congratulations â€” you've completed this hands-on lab!
