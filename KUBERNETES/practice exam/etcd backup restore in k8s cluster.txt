Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) - Practice Exam Part 4
---------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction
This lab provides practice scenarios to help prepare you for the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam. You will be presented with tasks to complete as well as server(s) and/or an existing Kubernetes cluster to complete them in. You will need to use your knowledge of Kubernetes to successfully complete the provided tasks, much like you would on the real CKA exam. Good luck!

Solution
Log in to the server using the credentials provided:

ssh cloud_user@<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>
Back Up the etcd Data
From the terminal, log in to the etcd server:

ssh etcd1
Back up the etcd data:

ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl snapshot save /home/cloud_user/etcd_backup.db \
--endpoints=https://etcd1:2379 \
--cacert=/home/cloud_user/etcd-certs/etcd-ca.pem \
--cert=/home/cloud_user/etcd-certs/etcd-server.crt \
--key=/home/cloud_user/etcd-certs/etcd-server.key
Restore the etcd Data from the Backup
Stop etcd:

sudo systemctl stop etcd
Delete the existing etcd data:

sudo rm -rf /var/lib/etcd
Restore etcd data from a backup:

sudo ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl snapshot restore /home/cloud_user/etcd_backup.db \
--initial-cluster etcd-restore=https://etcd1:2380 \
--initial-advertise-peer-urls https://etcd1:2380 \
--name etcd-restore \
--data-dir /var/lib/etcd
Set database ownership:

sudo chown -R etcd:etcd /var/lib/etcd
Start etcd:

sudo systemctl start etcd
Verify the system is working:

ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl get cluster.name \
--endpoints=https://etcd1:2379 \
--cacert=/home/cloud_user/etcd-certs/etcd-ca.pem \
--cert=/home/cloud_user/etcd-certs/etcd-server.crt \
--key=/home/cloud_user/etcd-certs/etcd-server.key
Conclusion
Congratulations â€” you've completed this hands-on lab!
