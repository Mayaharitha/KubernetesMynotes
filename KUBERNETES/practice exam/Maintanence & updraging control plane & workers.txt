CKA Practice Exam - Part 5
--------------------------
Introduction
This lab provides practice scenarios to help prepare you for the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam. You will be presented with tasks to complete as well as server(s) and/or an existing Kubernetes cluster to complete them in. You will need to use your knowledge of Kubernetes to successfully complete the provided tasks, much like you would on the real CKA exam. Good luck!

Solution
Log in to the server using the credentials provided:

ssh cloud_user@<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>
Upgrade All Kubernetes Components on the Control Plane Node
Switch to the appropriate context with kubectl:

kubectl config use-context acgk8s
Upgrade kubeadm:

sudo apt-get update && \
sudo apt-get install -y --allow-change-held-packages kubeadm=1.22.2-00
Drain the control plane node:

kubectl drain acgk8s-control --ignore-daemonsets
Plan the upgrade:

sudo kubeadm upgrade plan v1.22.2
Apply the upgrade:

sudo kubeadm upgrade apply v1.22.2
Upgrade kubelet and kubectl:

sudo apt-get update && \
sudo apt-get install -y --allow-change-held-packages kubelet=1.22.2-00 kubectl=1.22.2-00
Reload:

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
Restart kubelet:

sudo systemctl restart kubelet
Uncordon the control plane node:

kubectl uncordon acgk8s-control
Upgrade All Kubernetes Components on the Worker Node
Drain the worker1 node:

kubectl drain acgk8s-worker1 --ignore-daemonsets --force
SSH into the node:

ssh acgk8s-worker1
Install a new version of kubeadm:

sudo apt-get update && \
sudo apt-get install -y --allow-change-held-packages kubeadm=1.22.2-00
Upgrade the node:

sudo kubeadm upgrade node
Upgrade kubelet and kubectl:

sudo apt-get update && \
sudo apt-get install -y --allow-change-held-packages kubelet=1.22.2-00 kubectl=1.22.2-00
Reload:

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
Restart kubelet:

sudo systemctl restart kubelet
Type exit to exit the node.

Uncordon the node:

kubectl uncordon acgk8s-worker1
Repeat the process above for acgk8s-worker2 to upgrade the other worker node.

Conclusion
Congratulations â€” you've completed this hands-on lab!
